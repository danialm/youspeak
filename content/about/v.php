            YouSpeak is a web-based and mobile classroom interaction software system, developed 
            and used at California State University, Northridge. It provides a framework for students 
            to post a comment or question, or reply to a questions anonymously during class using the 
            web-based application. Moreover, they can rate up or down the comments of others in the class,
            to allow the most relevant questions to rise to the top of the list. Instructors can project 
            these comments alongside the course materials. Instructors have all the tools they need to manage 
            what is displaying to the students. They can post a comment, or question and also they can make 
            questionnaires for student to answer. Instructors have access to reports of their own courses, and 
            therefor are able to evaluate the interaction of their students.

            If you are interested in using this system in your class or in your
            presentation, send us an email (ani&#64;&#99;sun&#46;ed&#117;) and we will set-up an account for the course 
            instructor. Everything else is handled by the system, including students creating their own 
            accounts and logging in during class time; and instructors uploading slides, websites, or 
            other course material for presentation in class.
