YouSpeak is a web-based and mobile classroom interaction software system, developed and used at California State University, Northridge. It provides a framework for students to comment or ask questions anonymously during class using the web or a web-based app. Moreover, they can rate up or down the comments of others in the class, to allow the most relevant questions to rise to the top of the list. Instructors can project these comments alongside the course materials, including slides, documents, videos, or the marker board.

If you are interested in using this system in your class or in your presentation, send us an email (ani@csun.edu) and we will set-up an account for the course instructor. Everything else is handled by the system, including students creating their own accounts and logging in during class time; and instructors uploading slides, websites, or other course material for presentation in class.
